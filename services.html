            <p>As an aspiring full stack web developer, I am excited to offer the following services as part of my learning journey. These services reflect the skills I have acquired so far and the areas I am currently focusing on.</p>
            
            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>My primary focus is on building and structuring web pages using HTML and CSS. Hereâ€™s what I can offer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Creating the structure and content of web pages using HTML5.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Styling web pages to make them visually appealing and user-friendly.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
            <p>While I am still learning, I can add basic interactivity to web pages using JavaScript:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Implementing simple scripts to enhance user experience, such as form validation and dynamic content updates.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>Ensuring that websites are accessible and look great on all devices is a key aspect of web development. I am currently practicing responsive design techniques to achieve this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> Using CSS media queries to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Project Examples</h3>
            <p>As part of my practice, I have worked on several small projects that demonstrate my skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Portfolio:</strong> A website to showcase my projects and skills, built with HTML and CSS.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Blog:</strong> A basic blog platform to practice creating and managing content, incorporating some JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p>I am committed to continuous learning and improvement. My future goals include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mastering JavaScript to create more complex and interactive web applications.</li>
                <li>Learning backend development to handle server-side logic and database management.</li>
                <li>Exploring frameworks and libraries to enhance my development workflow.</li>
            </ul>
